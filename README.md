# BonBon Web Browser

Claim back your data ownership.

Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, Redux. The browser is faster than it sounds, it's worth to try it.

We don't collect any personal data or browsing history. We do send some events to GA in order to understand how users are using BonBon Browser. Those events do not contain any information regarding the user or his material.

Instead, the browsing history is locally stored and encrypted.
