# BonBon Web Browser

Claim back your data ownership.

Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, Redux. The browser is faster than it sounds, it's worth to try it.

We don't collect any personal data or browsing history. We do send some events to Nucleus.sh in order to understand how users are using BonBon Browser. Those events are no more than "open_app", "add_browser", "switch_board"... and will be removed when I will be more confident that the UX is good.

Instead, the browsing history is locally stored and encrypted.

### Notes for Windows

The application is not signed (there is no company yet behind it), and has been avaialble since June 10th, 2022. That's why Windows consider the app as dangerous.

### Notes for Linux

While it has not been tested on Linux, it should work. Please refer to how to run locally or to make a release further in this Readme.

### Notes for macOS

The app was not working before June 24th, 2022. I am sorry for the ones that tried to run it.
